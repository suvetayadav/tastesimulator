# Taste Simulator
<br>

* It generate the basic tastes like sweet, sour, salty and bitter without actually eating food of that tastes.
* Digital taste can be generated by electrical stimuli and thermal stimuli.
* The main factors which are responsible for a genrating a taste are frequency, current and temperature.
* The basic sqaure wave is genarted by using an arduino code with a particular frequency. the current is changed by using the accuarate size of potentiometer hera we hv used **10kΩ** potentiometer before that a fixed resisatnce of **5kΩ** is kept in series with the potentiometer. this is able to generate a current between **20uA** or **30mA**.
* The temperature is being changed using a peltier module. the temperature we are keeping are from **20C** to **35C**. which first constantly increases and after reaching the limited value the temperature is cuttoff using a thermostat.
