# Taste Simulator
<br>

* It generate the basic tastes like sweet, sour, salty and bitter without actually eating food of that tastes.
* Digital taste can be generated by electrical stimuli and thermal stimuli.
* The main factors which are responsible for a generating a taste are frequency, current and temperature.
* The basic square wave is generated by using an arduino microcontroller, hardcoded with a particular frequency.
* The current is changed by using the accurate size of potentiometer. Here, we have used **10kΩ** potentiometer before that a fixed resistance of **5kΩ** is kept in series with the potentiometer.
* This can able to generate a current between **20μA** or **30mA**.
* The temperature is being changed using a peltier module. The temperature we keeping are from **20°C** to **35°C**. At first, the temperature keeps constantly increases and when reached the limited value the power to the peltier module is cut-off by using a thermostat. Thus, the temperature decreases.
